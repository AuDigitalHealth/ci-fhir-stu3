### Summary Statement of Condition *[[Draft](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/valueset-publication-status.html)]*

#### Implementation guidance

For the expected usage scenarios in this implementation guide:

* It is expected that verificationStatus will be ‘confirmed’.

* It is expected that the clinicalStatus will be ‘active’.

* A ‘refuted’ condition should be represented with an appropriate negation code and a verificationStatus of ‘unconfirmed’ or ‘confirmed’ depending on the level of certainty.

* A 'refuted' condition should be represented with an appropriate negation code and a clinicalStatus of ‘inactive’.
