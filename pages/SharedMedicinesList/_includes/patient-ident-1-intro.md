#### Patient with Mandatory Identifier *[[Draft](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/valueset-publication-status.html)]*

#### Implementation guidance

For the overarching usage scenarios in this implementation guide:
* it is recommended that an Australian address conforms to the [AU Base Address Profile](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base-stu3//StructureDefinition-au-address.html)

When sending a shared medicines list to the My Health Record system it is expected that:
* patient will not include an address
* a patient will include an IHI as the identifier
