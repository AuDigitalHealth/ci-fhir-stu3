## Introduction

The Advance Care Records implementation guide is intended to support multiple usage scenarios; some profiles described within this implementation guide are reused across usage scenarios and other implementation guides.

This informative section provides a mapping from the requirements of each end-product clinical specification to elements in a profiled FHIR resource. At the time of publication of this implementation guide the end-product clinical specifications supported are Advance Care Planning (ACP), Goals of Care (GOC), and Advance Care Directive Custodian Record (ACDCR).

The mapping from requirements tables below demonstrate the logical decomposition of each requirement to the lowest possible element in an applicable profile.

## Mapping from ACP information requirements

There are no published information requirements available for Advance Care Planning.

## Mapping from GOC information requirements

There are no published information requirements available for Goals of Care.

## Mapping from ACDCR information requirements

The table below provides mapping from the data items (i.e. requirements) in Information Requirements - <a href="index.html#NEHT2011bf">Information regarding the Custodian of an Advance Care Directive [NEHT2011bf]</a>.

## Legend for mapping from requirements

The mapping from requirements tables below demonstrate the logical decomposition of each requirement to the lowest possible element in an applicable profile.

<table class="list" width="100%">
	<col style="width:20%"/>
	<col style="width:20%"/>

            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Requirement</th>
                    <th>Req. No</th>
                    <th>Element name</th>
                    <th>Hierarchy</th>
                    <th>Additional notes</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><p>The heading text of the requirement as taken from the requirements specification.</p></td>
                    <td><p>The requirement number as taken from the requirements specification.</p></td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Either the name of the lowest element in a profiled FHIR resource that addresses the requirement or 'N/A' where 
                        the requirement has been deemed not applicable to a FHIR profile.</p>
                       <p>If the lowest possible decomposition is to the resource then only the resource name (e.g. Patient) is present. 
                    If the lowest possible decomposition is to one or more child elements of a FHIR resource then a dot notation is 
                    used to indicate the hierarchical relationship.</p>
                       <p>For example Patient.communication.language indicates 
                    the requirement maps to the language element, that is a child of the communication element, 
                    in the Patient FHIR resource.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Either the full hierarchical path from the root FHIR resource (e.g. Composition) to the element 
                    the requirement is mapped to or 'N/A' where the requirement has been deemed not applicable to a FHIR profile.</p>
                        <p>A dot notation is used to demonstrate hierarchy within a FHIR resource.</p>
                        <p>An arrow '<span style="font-family:courier;">&#62;</span>' is used to denote the reference connecting one FHIR resource 
                    to another from the linking element. For example Composition.subject> Patient or Composition.author> Patient.</p>
                    <p>Where a requirement is addressed by multiple elements, the elements are presented in order of appearance in the profiled FHIR resource.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Additional notes are provided where a gap between a requirement, or parts of a requirement, and the 
                    profiles is identified. Where a requirement is fully addressed by the mapped elements then no entry in this 
                    column is expected.</p>
