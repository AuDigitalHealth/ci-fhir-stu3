<p>Provenance.entity.agent is a reference to another element (Provenance.agent) but as the target element has been sliced into two slices, it appears that the reference cannot be found.
An XML example incorporating a Provenance.entity.agent passed validation.</p>

<p>Elements such as 'who[x]' or 'what[x]' get renamed if there is only a single choice of data types. However, in some elements the renaming differs and what should be rendered as 'whoReference:whoReference', is rendered as 'who[x]:whoReference'. The issue has been raised with the Profile Editor software provider (Forge/Firely) who have acknowledged this as a bug and are attending to a fix.</p>
