### Base RelatedPerson

#### Usage scenarios
The following are the usage scenarios expected:

* Details of a related person exchanged as referenced entry in a composition.

Further scoping of applicable usage scenarios (e.g. point-to-point or point-to-share) is done at the referencing profiles. 


#### Implementation guidance
* Medical Record Number: identifier system can be completed using the [HPI-O based Medical Record Identifier](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/local/provider/1.0) namespace if an organisation does not have its own namespace and has an HPI-O. An example of the syntax using this namespace is "http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/local/medicalrecord/1.0/8003620000000000". The dummy HPI-O should be replaced with the assigning entity's own HPI-O.
