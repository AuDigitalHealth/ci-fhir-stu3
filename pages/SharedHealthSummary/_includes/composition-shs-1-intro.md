* A CIS sends or receives an Shared Health Summary with another CIS or CSP
* A CSP sends or receives an Shared Health Summary with a CIS or another CSP
* A registered portal or registered repository receives an Shared Health Summary

When sending a Shared Health Summary to the My Health Record system it is expected that all instances of patient will conform to [My Health Record Patient](StructureDefinition-patient-mhr-1.html).
