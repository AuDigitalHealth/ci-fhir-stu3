# Reporting issues or queries

Issues can be used to:

* Report a defect
* Request a new feature or enhancement
* Ask a question

First, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-stu3/issues?q=is%3Aopen) and [closed issues](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-stu3/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) to see if your issue hasn't already been reported (it may also be fixed).

If you can't find an issue that matches what you're seeing, open a new issue which will be automatically populated with a [template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) that highlights the information that needs to be submitted with an issue that describes a defect. 

If the issue is not related to a defect, please just delete the template and replace it with a detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve, or the question being asked.

Please provide us with enough information to investigate further.
