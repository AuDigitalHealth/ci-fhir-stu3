In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"BackboneElement.modifierExtension",0,*,"","","N/A"

","Label for section (e.g. for ToC)","The label for this particular section.  This will be part of the rendered content for the document, and is often used to build a table of contents.","The title identifies the section for a human reader. The title must be consistent with the narrative of the resource that is the target of the section.content reference. Generally, sections SHOULD have titles, but in some documents, it is unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, this is where a section has subsections that have their own adequately distinguishing title,  or documents that only have a single section. Most Implementation Guides will make section title to be a required element.","Section headings are often standardized for different types of documents.
